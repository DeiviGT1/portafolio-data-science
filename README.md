# 🌟 Data Scientist Portfolio 🌟

Welcome to my **Data Scientist Portfolio**. Here, you will find various projects showcasing my skills and work in data science.

## Projects 🚀

### 1. -  📊 Predicción de Calificación
This project involves conducting a study of the characteristics of items that were rated as winners and those that were rated as losers to determine which have the potential to be one or the other. The goal is to choose the best type of clothing for the future in a clothing company.

### 7. 📊 Dashboard
This was an example that I made to show my habilities by managing dashboards, even when I have much more experience using Power BI instead of Tableau but I don't have the licence anymore so for the example I had to use the second one. It's a database with data of Google Play Store downloaded and fixed using Python, also used Postgres to manage the database with SQL and finally imported the data to tableau
